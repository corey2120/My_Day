# Device Calendar Sync - Now Working! ðŸ“…

## Overview
MyDay now syncs with your device's calendar - works with Google Calendar, Outlook, or any calendar synced to your Android device!

## Features
âœ… **No setup required** - Just grant permission and sync
âœ… **Works with all calendars** - Google, Outlook, Exchange, etc.
âœ… **Smart duplicate detection** - Won't import the same event twice
âœ… **Automatic categorization** - Creates a "Calendar Events" task list
âœ… **Sync upcoming events** - Imports next 30 days by default
âœ… **Shows calendar info** - Displays which calendars are available
âœ… **All-day event support** - Handles both timed and all-day events

## How to Use

1. **Open MyDay** and go to Settings
2. **Find "Calendar Sync"** section
3. **Click "Grant Calendar Permission"** - Allow the app to read your calendar
4. **View your calendars** - The app will show which calendars it found
5. **Click "Sync Calendar Events"** - Imports upcoming events as tasks
6. **Done!** Events now appear in:
   - Your calendar view on the home screen
   - The "Calendar Events" task list in Tasks tab
   - On their scheduled dates

## What Gets Synced
- Event title (with calendar name in parentheses)
- Event date and time
- All events from the next 30 days
- From ALL calendars on your device

## Tips
- Sync regularly to keep events up to date
- Events are imported, not synced back (one-way import)
- Mark imported events as complete just like regular tasks
- Re-syncing won't create duplicates

## Example
If you have a meeting "Team Standup" on Friday at 10 AM in your Google Calendar:
- It will import as: "Team Standup (from Google)" 
- Appears on Friday in your MyDay calendar
- Shows in the "Calendar Events" task list
- Can be marked complete when done

Enjoy seamless calendar integration! ðŸŽ‰
